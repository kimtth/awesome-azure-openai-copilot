# Contributing

Contributions are highly valued! Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Edit the `README.md` file to add your entry
3. Make sure your entry follows the format: `- [**Project Name**](URL) - Description`
4. Submit a pull request

## Guidelines

- Entries should be related to Gemini CLI (e.g. use it, build something on top of it, upgrade it in some way, etc.)
- Add your item to the **top** of each section &mdash; new additions deserve more prominence for a time.

Then you can optionally add a badge to your project's README:

```
[![Mentioned in Awesome Gemini CLI](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli)
```
[![Mentioned in Awesome Gemini CLI](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli)

There's also a flat version of the badge you can use instead if you prefer:
```
[![Mentioned in Awesome Gemini CLI](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli)
```
[![Mentioned in Awesome Gemini CLI](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli)
